## 🎯 Phase 3: Reports Dashboard Upgrade

### Search Functionality
**Real-time Search**
- Search reports by document number, customer ID, or template ID
- Case-insensitive matching
- Instant filtering as you type
- Search input with placeholder text

### Date Range Filtering
**Filter by Creation Date**
- Start date input (filter reports from this date onwards)
- End date input (filter reports up to this date)
- Combined date range filtering
- Clear filters button to reset all filters

### UI/UX Improvements
**Enhanced Reports List**

- "No reports found" message when filters return no results
- Responsive filter layout (mobile-friendly)
- Improved visual feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
**File**: `frontend/src/App.jsx`

**New State Variables**:
```javascript
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [dateRange, setDateRange] = useState({ start: '', end: '' });
const [filteredReports, setFilteredReports] = useState([]);
```

**Filtering Logic**:
- `useEffect` hook monitors `reports`, `searchQuery`, and `dateRange`
- Client-side filtering for fast, responsive UX
- Filters applied sequentially (search → start date → end date)

**UI Components**:
- Search input (flex: 1, min-width: 200px)
- Two date inputs (min-width: 150px each)
- Clear filters button
- Report count badge
