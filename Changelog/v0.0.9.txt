[CHANGELOG]
Version: v0.0.9
Date: 11 Aralık 2025

## 🚀 New Features & Improvements
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Added `jest` and `supertest` for API testing.
- **Database Scripts**: Added scripts for future migration from JSON to MySQL/MariaDB.
  - `scripts/init-db.js`: Initializes database and schema.
  - `scripts/migrate-data.js`: Migrates data from JSON files to database.
- **Backend Refactoring**: Refactored `src/app.js` to be testable (decoupled server listen).

## 🛠 Fixes & Changes
- Updated `package.json` with `test` script and dev dependencies (`mariadb`, `jest`, `supertest`).
- Investigated and documented database authentication issues with MariaDB.

## ⚠️ Notes
- Database migration is prepared but currently disabled due to local environment auth constraints. System continues to run on JSON files.
